# Copilot Hackathon

Welcome to our exciting hackathon where you can level up your coding skills and make significant contributions to a file management application. This hackathon is designed to challenge your abilities at different levels, from basic file handling to advanced performance optimizations. Get ready to tackle various problem statements and take your coding expertise to new heights.

## Level 1: File Management and Testing

In the first level, we're focusing on fundamental file management tasks and test-driven development. Your mission is to build a file management application that allows users to read file contents, display them in the console, write user input to the file, clear the file's content, and exit the operation gracefully. The cycle continues until the user decides to exit. Add a sample text file with 5 inspiring quotes. Additionally, you'll set up a unit test project and create test cases to ensure the application's reliability. Don't forget to leverage Copilot to fix any bugs you encounter during this level. Your ultimate goal is to build and execute both the application and the test cases successfully.

## Level 2: Comprehensive Documentation

In this level, it's time to document your code thoroughly. You'll add documentation to all files, including your test cases. Clear and concise documentation is key to ensuring that your work can be understood and maintained by others.

## Level 3: Security and Exception Handling

This level focuses on security and exception handling. 
   - Identify any potential security concerns and address them appropriately.
   - Add specific exception handling blocks to your code to ensure it handles errors gracefully.
While we're emphasizing security, you can ignore any remaining security issues for this level.

## Level 4: Performance Optimization

The final level challenges you to improve the performance of your code. 
   - Identify areas where you can optimize and implement one of the suggested performance improvements.
Efficient code not only runs faster but also uses resources more effectively.

## Level 5: Expanding Test Coverage

In the fifth and final level, we're taking your application to the next level by expanding your test coverage. As you've made code changes and optimizations in the previous levels, it's crucial to ensure your new and improved code remains reliable and robust.

Your task in this level is to add additional test cases that cover the code changes made throughout the hackathon. These new test cases should encompass various scenarios and edge cases to verify the correctness and resilience of your code. By doing so, you will further enhance the quality and maintainability of your application.


Are you ready to take on these coding challenges? Your efforts will not only enhance your skills but also contribute to a robust and efficient file management application. So, put on your coding hat and join us in this hackathon to level up your development abilities! 

**Best of luck, and let's bring this hackathon to a successful conclusion!**
